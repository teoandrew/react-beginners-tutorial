# react-beginners-tutorial

Learning React with Mosh https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke90Tje7VS0

Going to make it a habit of coming up with thorough documentation, even for this README file.

A bit of background on this React Tutorial and why I'm starting it:
I wanted to immediately start an intermediate React + Firebase project which is about building a social media app by
FreeCodeCamp. However, it was suggested that it wouldn't be beneficial for me to follow if I didn't know React at all.

I aim to nail down the fundamentals of React going through this tutorial, then either jump into a beginner's guide to
JavaScript or just wing it and try said intermediate project again.

**Regarding the old and new React app commits:**  
The old one was created with npm, and Mosh specifically requested that we create the app using the commands:
_sudo npm i -g create-react-app@1.5.2_.
However, according to a StackOverflow contributor named Ali, he mentioned in his answer to this question
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31976722/start-script-missing-error-when-running-npm-start that from December of
2019, npm no longer supports global installations, and therefore I must use the _npx_ command instead.
To provide further context on this, Mosh's tutorial video was created in 2018.
