# react-beginners-tutorial

Learning React with Mosh https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke90Tje7VS0

Going to make it a habit of coming up with thorough documentation, even for this README file.

A bit of background on this React Tutorial and why I'm starting it:
I wanted to immediately start an intermediate React + Firebase project which is about building a social media app by
FreeCodeCamp. However, it was suggested that it wouldn't be beneficial for me to follow if I didn't know React at all.

I aim to nail down the fundamentals of React going through this tutorial, then either jump into a beginner's guide to
JavaScript or just wing it and try said intermediate project again.
